Welcome to my contribution tracker! This file is a log of my work within the Meshery and Layer5 open-source communities, plus Flutter contributions. Inside, you'll find a record of my involvement through "Issues" and "Pull Requests" (PRs).[3]

For non-technical:

An "Issue" can be thought of as the starting point—a task, a bug report, or an idea for a new feature or improvement. A "Pull Request" or "PR" is my proposed solution to an issue, containing the actual code or documentation I've written. This work is then reviewed by other developers before it becomes a permanent part of the project. This log helps me track my progress and showcases my commitment to these open source projects.

I use specific symbols in this table to clearly indicate my role in the creation of each item.

The check mark (✓) signifies an item I created. A ✓ next to an Issue means I was the one who opened the idea, bug report, or task. A ✓ next to a Pull Request (PR) means the proposed solution, code, or documentation was authored by me.

The cross mark (✗) signifies an item that someone else opened, but I actively contributed to it. An ✗ next to an Issue means I worked on a task or a reported bug that was opened by another contributor. An ✗ next to a PR means I collaborated on or contributed code to a Pull Request that was initiated by someone else (for example, as a co-author).
